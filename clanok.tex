\section{Introduction}

In the past few years, video games have started getting more and more popular. In the past not many people could afford playing video games. Computers were exceedingly expensive, and gaming consoles were no better. As the time passed, electronic devices became more affordable for everyone. The age range of video game players is also expanding precipitously. Just a few years ago, video games were designed for teenagers, and young adults. These days, it is not uncommon to find a toddler playing with a smartphone, a mature adult, sitting in front of television playing games on a console, or even an elder, playing on a computer. As the video games are expanding among more and more people, their impacts on humans are also getting larger.

\section{Introduction}

Over the last few, video games have started to gain popularity, and the increase is far from stopping. In the past, not many people could afford to play video games. Computers were exceedingly expensive, and gaming consoles were no better. As time passed, electronic devices became more affordable for everyone. The age range of video game players is also expanding precipitously. Video games, in general, were designed to entertain teenagers and young adults. These days, it is not uncommon to find a toddler playing with a smartphone, a mature adult sitting in front of television playing games on a console, or even an elder, playing on a computer. As video games are expanding among more and more people, their influence, whether it is positive or negative, is also getting more vast. That is why we should focus more on the issue of video games and their impacts on humans, which will be the main topic of this work.
